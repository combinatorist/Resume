# Professional Experience
## Data Integration Developer
(AxialHealthcare: March 2017 - Present)
- Switched to new Data Integration & Management team under new Enterprise Data Architect
- Pioneered "Code as Architecture" (Terraform) on DIM team
- Pioneered "Serverless Architecture" (AWS API Gateway, Lambda Functions, DynamoDB) at Axial
- Helped plan essential tooling to support Data Lake Architecture (AWS S3)
- Built terraform-deployable "Serverless" API to manage metadata for Data Lake
- Started remodeling extensible version of our "Core Analytics" (Spark Scala on AWS EMR)
- Began study for AWS Solutions Associate Certificate
- Attended AWS RE:Invent Conference 2017

## Junior Data Scientist
(AxialHealthcare: September 2015 - February 2017)
- Hired to do Data Science in early stages of startup (employee \#16)
- Found Data Scientists manually delivering results directly to clients with large, disorganized repository of ad hoc SQL queries
- Determined greatest need was actually starting SDLC, and automating / productionalizing code base
- Fixed over 40 (often intricate) analytical / healthcare data quality bugs
- Completed over 100 analytical, design, and process improvements
- Acted as _de facto_ Data Science Engineer / Technical Lead:
  - Immediately built tools to parse, plan, and automate arbitrary GBQ SQL queries (Python, Celery)
  - Helped negotiate data formats with clients until we hired dedicated resources
  - Advocated, trained, and consulted for team on git, Python, SDLC, Scrum, statistics, SQL, and RDB design
  - Insisted on better documentation, process, and accountability at all levels
  - Documented many concepts, processes, requirements, decisions, and training materials
  - Began productionalization of "Core Analytics" code base for regular, predictable delivery to client
  - Planned & implemented many system-wide code improvements to statistics, standardization, and usability
  - Earned ownership to define SDLC, test, and vet changes to "Core" code
  - Split "Core" well-tested IP calculations from quickly changing, relatively superficial reporting OLAP code
  - Defined releases and reported methodological / analytical impact to President and leadership
  - Planned major database / process redesigns, creating simplified API layer
  - Analyzed risk and scope of switching from GBQ to AWS Redshift or Postgres
  - Planned and reviewed internal solutions from ETL and App teams
  - Requested, helped define, and interviewed Data QA resource for critical and complex "Core" code
- Acted as Data Scientist:
  - Advised Product team on statistical aspects of UI
  - Helped negotiate short and long term improvements to our "Core Analytics" metric definitions etc
  - Researched and developed backend analytics for our "RISE" product MVP
  - Helped interview Data Scientists - prepared and conducted technical portions (SQL & Python)
  - Created Data Science Roadmap to build from basic data collection up to ML
  - Worked with pharmacist on early research into predicting Opioid Overdoses

## Associate Data Analyst
(Infospace/Blucora: January 2014 – April 2015)
- Supported our data scientist by conducting ad hoc analyses, proof of concepts, and researching new technologies
- Won “Spark” award for algorithm development in my keyword re-categorization study (data mining / clustering)
- Attended 2 Big Data conferences and collaborated to design and run our team’s first Hadoop project (AWS EMR)
- Maintained technical relationships w/ other companies (HowStuffWorks, eContext / Zenya) in acquiring process
- Designed and oversaw tests of eContext’s Keyword and Content Classifiers & gave 2 hr. presentation to President
- Frequently read source code and documentation, discussed algorithm improvements with leads, and wrote specs

## Intern Big Data Analyst
(Infospace/Blucora: August 2013 – December 2013)
- Conducted a pilot study of SNA/graph clustering techniques on our keyword library (Gephi)
- Won “Blaze” award for finding a year-old bug in our UX A/B testing platform
- Built, tested, and maintained ETL process to give the company actionable device revenue data (XL, SQL)
- Used R and Python to run clustering algorithms and perform standard and customized statistical calculations
- Wrote complex SQL queries to our on-premise IBM Netezza Machine and the cloud (AWS Redshift)
